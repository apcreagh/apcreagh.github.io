## Welcome 
I am a Digital Health & AI/ML Scientist. I am currently lead the applied AI/ML research team at Sanome at [Sanome](https://www.sanome.com/){:target="\_blank"}, where we’re building personalised AI-powered clinical decision support tools to continuously predict individual health outcomes using routinely collected multimodal electronic health record (EHR) and wearable data, with models regulated as \textbf{software-as-a-medical-device (SaMD)}. I am concurrently a Visiting Researcher at the laboratory at the University of Oxford.

## Research 
My research aims to explore how we can capture digital biomarkers of disease using multimodal digital health data and AI/ML to inform early warning of clinical events. I have a specific interest in how the integration of digital health technologies (DHT)---like smartwatches and wearable sensors---will augment routinely collected clinical data and electronic health records (EHR) to enhance patient treatment strategies, uncover digital phenotypes and ultimately develop personalised patient monitoring stratagies and truly personalised healthcare for patients. 

Clinical applications of AI/ML (machine learning) can act as powerful tools to learn complex and unseen digital patterns of disease, to help remotely monitor and identify signs of degeneration before they occur, and to understand new facets of habitual disease and disease phenotypes. My technical areas of expertise include AI/ML for disease prediction, explainable AI (XAI), and time-series analysis. I have a specific interest in creating interpretable, robust, and validated digital biomarkers through explainable AI (XAI) frameworks. 

## Background 
I obtained my DPhil. (PhD) in Clinical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, developing digital biomarkers in collaboration with industrial partners, [F. Hoffmann-La Roche](https://www.roche.com/about/priorities/personalised_healthcare/digital-biomarkers.htm){:target="\_blank"}. 

Following my DPhil, I was a [GSK](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/){:target="\_blank"} Postdoctoral Fellow in Digital Biomarkers and 
a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Computational Health Informatics (CHI)](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi/){:target="\_blank"} laboratory at the University of Oxford led by [Prof. David A. Clifton](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi/team/){:target="\_blank"}, as well as the [Oxford Wearables Laboratory](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/research/wearables-group){:target="\_blank"} led by [Prof. Aiden Doherty](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/aiden-doherty){:target="\_blank"} at the [Big Data Institute (BDI)](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Oxford. <br>  

My research explored the development of validated digital biomarkers for clinical trial (CT) end-points and prescribed digital therapeutics (DTx) using consumer digital health technologies (DHT) collected from smartphone and smartwatch app. sensors. I have worked with CT data from patients in a range of Therapeutic Areas (TA) from multiple sclerosis to Parkinson’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, and mental health.

Prior to my DPhil. I hold a bachelor’s degree (BAI, BA) in Biomedical Engineering and master’s degree (MAI) in Neural Engineering from Trinity College, the University of Dublin. My research at Trinity investigated the use of machine learning techniques to predict the onset of dementia in later life, through the characterisation of gait and cognitive performance from routine clinical assessments conducted during the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA).
