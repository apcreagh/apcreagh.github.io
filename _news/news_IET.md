I have been announced as this year‚Äôs winners of the prestigious Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Healthcare Technologies, William James Award for early-career researchers. I was recognised by IET for my work developing developing smartphone-based technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) strategies to monitor disease progression for people with neurodegenerative diseases. 

## The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Healthcare Technologies Awards
The annual Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Healthcare Technologies Awards encourage and support the work and research of academics and newly qualified professionals in healthcare, medical and biomedical engineering arenas. The IET William James Award, instated by Professor Christopher James in honour of his late father William James, is presented to an early-career researcher whose PhD work ‚Äúhas demonstrated the most potential to contribute towards the development and improvement of the Biomedical Engineering field‚Äù. 

The IET William James Award was presented specifically for my research where I helped to develop a simple smartphone-based, at-home examination tool, named ‚ÄúDraw-a-Shape‚Äù, which was the first published step in validating digital biomarkers for MS, from the landmark FLOODLIGHT study.  An example of my research can be found at: [https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ab8771](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ab8771)

I would like to express my gratitude to my PI Prof. Clifton, Prof. Maarten De Vos, F-Hoffmann La Roche, GSK, as well as all our collaborators and those who have mentored us along the way‚Äù.

As part of the award, I recieve a ¬£500 prize, a years free membership to IET, as well as a guest lecture on my reserach at the IET Annual Healthcare Lecture on Wednesday 8th December 2021 from 10:00 ‚Äì 11:30am GMT.
